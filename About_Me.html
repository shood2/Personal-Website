      About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sadie Hood is a current student at Northwestern university from a small town in Eastern Maine.

      Sadie is interested in how Computer Science can be used to aid the accessibility of quality
      education for people around the globe. She is also interested in the study and application
      of Natural Language Understanding and how that can be used in the field of education as well,
      particularly when focused on language learning and teaching. She believes that Computer
      Science can be used to lessen the divide in quality and accessibility of education in poorer
      areas in addition to the dramatic lack of funding for education in many areas.
